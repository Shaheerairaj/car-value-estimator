# Overview

This project aims to build a simple web app which users can use to get an estimate of the value of a car they are interested in.

It can be used to get an idea of what it might cost to buy or sell their car at current market value and conditions of the car.

# Steps

1. Build a webscraper to scrap data from dubizzle and potentially other websites like carswitch
2. Store the data in SQL databse (optional)
3. Analyze the data
4. Build a model which will predict the estimate of the value of a car
5. Build a simple webapp which will use the model trained in step 3
6. Deploy the app locally using docker
7. Deploy the app on the cloud using AWS/Heroku/GCP/Snowflake
